Testing and Version Control
This module name Testing and Version Control was one the exciting module i've been through since i have joined Executive Pg in Software Development From Upgrad. The module gave me detailed experience with Branching,Mergening, how to attend merging conflits, how to fork a repository, how to clone a repository make changes to it and make pull requests.
